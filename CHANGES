0.1.2:

* Rev::Loop.default used to call ev_loop_default() (in C).  However, this
  registers signal handlers which conflict with Ruby's own.  Now the behavior
  has been changed to return a thread-local singleton of Rev::Loop.

* Creating a new Rev::TCPListener will disable reverse lookups in BasicSocket

* Made backlog for Rev::TCPListener user-definable

* Rev::TCPSocket now implements an on_resolve_failed callback for failed DNS
  resolution.  By default it's aliased to on_connect_failed.

* Changed event_callbacks to use instance_exec rather than passing the
  watcher object as an argument.  Documented use of defining an event
  callback as a block

* Subsecond precision for Rev::TimerWatchers

0.1.1:

* Added Rev::HttpClient, an asynchronous HTTP/1.1 client written on top of
  the Rev::TCPSocket class

* Imported HTTP response parser from the RFuzz project

* Added exception handling for Errno::ECONNRESET and Errno::EAGAIN

* Fixed bugs in buffered writer which resulted in exceptions if all data
  couldn't be written with a nonblocking write.

0.1.0:

* Initial public release
