0.2.1:

* Track attached watchers in C

* Add underscore prefix to instance variables to avoid conflicts in subclasses

* Remove Rev::SSLServer until it can be made more useful

0.2.0:

* Initial Ruby 1.8.6 support

* Omit Rev::LIBEV_VERSION constant

* Catch Errno::ECONNRESET when writing to sockets

* SSL support via Rev::SSL, with a small C extension subclassing Ruby's
  OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket allowing for non-blocking SSL handshakes

* Initial Rev::Utils implementation with #ncpus and methods to query and
  change the maximum number of file descriptors for the current process.

* Initial Rev::AsyncWatcher implementation for cross-thread signaling

* Handle unspecified Content-Length when encoding is identity in HttpClient

* Fix bug in HttpClient processing zero Content-Length

* Get rid of method_missing stuff in Rev::HttpClient

* Have Rev::HttpClient close the connection on error

* Allow Rev::TCPSocket#on_connect to be private when accepting connections
  from a Rev::TCPServer

0.1.4:

* Calibrate Rev::TimerWatchers against ev_time() and ev_now() when the watcher
  is attached to the loop to ensure that the timeout interval is correct.

* Add check to ensure that a Rev::Loop cannot be run from within a callback

* Store Rev::Loop.default in a Thread-specific instance variable

* Upgrade libev to 0.3.0

* Rename BufferedIO to IO

* Fixed bug in BufferedIO#write_output_buffer causing it to spin endlessly on
  an empty buffer.

* Added has_active_watchers? to Rev::Loop to check for active watchers

0.1.3:

* Fixed bug in Rev::Buffer read_from and write_to: now rb_sys_fail on failed
  reads/writes.

* Change Rev::Buffer memory pools to purge on a periodic interval, rather than
  whenever the GC marks the object.

* Fix bug in tracking the active watcher count.  Factor shared watcher behavior
  from rev_watcher.h to rev_watcher.c.

0.1.2:

* Commit initial specs

* Improve RDoc for the library

* Eliminate "zero copy" writes as they bypass the event loop

* Added Rev::Buffer C extension to provide high speed buffered writes

* Implement Rev::TCPSocket#peeraddr to improve compatibility with Ruby sockets

* Added Rev::Listener.close for clean shutdown of a listener

* Rev::Loop.default used to call ev_loop_default() (in C).  However, this
  registers signal handlers which conflict with Ruby's own.  Now the behavior
  has been changed to return a thread-local singleton of Rev::Loop.

* Creating a new Rev::TCPListener will disable reverse lookups in BasicSocket

* Made backlog for Rev::TCPListener user-definable

* Rev::TCPSocket now implements an on_resolve_failed callback for failed DNS
  resolution.  By default it's aliased to on_connect_failed.

* Changed event_callbacks to use instance_exec rather than passing the
  watcher object as an argument.  Documented use of defining an event
  callback as a block

* Subsecond precision for Rev::TimerWatchers

0.1.1:

* Added Rev::HttpClient, an asynchronous HTTP/1.1 client written on top of
  the Rev::TCPSocket class

* Imported HTTP response parser from the RFuzz project

* Added exception handling for Errno::ECONNRESET and Errno::EAGAIN

* Fixed bugs in buffered writer which resulted in exceptions if all data
  couldn't be written with a nonblocking write.

0.1.0:

* Initial public release
